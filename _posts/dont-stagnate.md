title: Don't stagnate

A couple of days ago, my eyes got catched by [a tweet from Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/506812869036347392):

> Nothing wrong with being n00b, just with staying a n00b when you have a choice.

I must admit I don't like the word n00b at all. You don't simply stop being noob one day and become a _senior_ or a _pro_. Not in one day, nor in ten years, you'll be always a noob in many different skills. But I'm pretty sure this is not what Beck wanted to say and I loved the underlying idea so much that it pushed me to write this post.

We just can't afford stagnation. Going further, those who stagnate are in fact getting worse year by year. Not only compared to other developers who are actually moving forward, but also by acquiring bad habits that need to be identified and removed.

I've seen something similar to developers' stagnation in some web applications. Like devs, applications can stagnate. And after this happens, they start to show signs of decay. Not in vain, the apps we develop reflect many aspects of ourselves.

So look at the apps you've been crafting lately. Are they stagnated or moving, day by day, towards a better design? If the apps you are currently involved in seem stuck and rusty, may be you should better look at yourself. You're still in time.
