### Introduction

If you have visited my blog before maybe you remember my old but cute Drupal web page painted in blue. What a big change from that, right? Indeed, the changes I've made to this blog may serve as a metaphor on how much my own life has changed. Let me talk about it, okay?


### From Spanish to English

The most shocking change you will probably notice is that I am talking to you in English. It makes writing posts a bit harder for me, and maybe you're not reading this as fluently as before if you are Spanish. But, hey, this is good for both of us.

There are many reasons to write a blog in English, but the main reason I'm doing it: face it, English is the _lingua franca_ of the Internet and we all should be using it for professional matters. Furthermore, I feel a lack of comfort with my English and want to practise it and get better. I think these are enough reasons for making the switch, don't you?

My twitter will still be in Spanish, as I still consider it my personal, not professional, space.


### From Drupal to Sinatra

The other big change is the move from Drupal to Sinatra. Drupal is designed for building a blog, so why did I rewrite it?

**Learning**

Well, I am currently discovering Ruby (although I did a small project with Rails a year ago or so) and writing a personal webpage is a good place to start.

**Removing waste**

Guess what? This new blog doesn't use any database. Okay, it's not that uncommon nowadays, but Drupal does use one. This website does not manage users, nor does it need to. I've removed comments (maybe I'll integrate the site with Disqus soon), tags (I don't consider them useful) and everything else that I felt was unnecessary.

  In the same way, I'm removing waste from my life. I'm removing some memories that make me feel bad from time to time. I'm dropping relations with people I dislike. I'm reducing my dependence on things. And I'm learning to be happy with just *the things I need*. My girlfriend, my family, my good friends, my dogs, my long walks, my coding time.

Regarding code, I'm moving from heavy frameworks to thinner ones. I enjoy building things from scratch or wiring existing components. That makes me feel free and creative!


### From a startup to freelancer

  In the new version of *carlescliment.com* I've created a new [home page](/) containing my personal profile. In June 2012 I gave myself one year to succeed with a startup and I failed. So a new stage in my professional life has begun. I don't know if I'm going to be more successful now. But surely I'll learn along the way.
