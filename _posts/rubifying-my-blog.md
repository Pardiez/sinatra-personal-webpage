### Introduction

If you have visited my blog before may be you remember my old but cute Drupal web page painted in blue. What a big change since then, right? Indeed, the changes I've made to this blog may serve as a metaphore on how much has changed my own life. Let me talk about it, okay?


### From Spanish to English

The most shocking change you will probably notice is that I am talking to you in English. It makes me writing posts a bit harder, and may be you do not read me as fluently as before if you are Spanish. But, hey, this is good for both of us.

There are many reasons to write a blog in English, but the one I'm doing it to is: English is the _lingua franca_ in the Internet and we all should be using it for professional matters. Furthermore, I feel a lack of comfort with my English and want to practise and get better. I think these are enough reasons for making the switch, don't you?

My twitter will still be in Spanish, so long as I consider it in my personal, not professional, space.


### From Drupal to Sinatra

The other big change is the move from Drupal to Sinatra. Drupal is okay for building a blog, and I could just wire this with that and obtain the same website in Drupal. So why did I rewrote my site?

**Learning**

  Yes, I am currently discovering Ruby (although I did a small project with Rails a year ago or so) and writing an own personal webpage is a good place to start with.

**Removing waste**

  You know? This new blog doesn't use any database. Okay, it's not uncommon nowadays, but Drupal does. This website does not manage users, nor it needs. I've removed comments (maybe I integrate the site with Disqus soon), tags (which I consider unuseful) and everything that was unnecessary.

  In the same way, I'm removing waste from my life. I'm removing some memories that make me feel badly from time to time. I'm dropping down my relations with people I dislike. I'm losing the affections to things. And I'm learning to stand *only with the things I need*. My girlfriend, my family, my good friends, my dogs, my long walks, my coding time.


### From lost to freelancer

  In the new version of *carlescliment.com* I've created a new [home page](/) containing my personal profile. I gave me one year to succeed with a startup and I failed, so a new stage in my professional life has arisen. I don't know if I'm going to be more successful now. But surely I'll learn in the way.
